<h4>Description</h4>

Internally, w2ui objects often call trigger to execute event listeners. The trigger function is called twice.
One time before the default actions and second time after. To differentiate when the trigger function is called, the object
uses <span class="argument">phase</span> property and only the listeners that are attached to that phase will be triggered. When you
add an event listener, you can optionally specify <span class="argument">execute</span> property ("before" or "after") that
defines when event handler will be executed. The default value of <span class="argument">execute</span> is "before."
<div style="height: 10px"></div>

For example when user clicks on the record in the w2grid, the following code will be executed:
<textarea class="javascript">
// event before
var eventData = this.trigger({ phase: 'before', target: this.name, type: 'click', 
							   recid: recid, event: event });
if (eventData.stop === true) return false;

// default grid click action

// event after
this.trigger($.extend(eventData, { phase: 'after' }));
</textarea>

As you see from the example above, the default action can be cancelled by event handler setting 
<span class="argument">eventData.stop</span> to true. There is no need to return <span class="argument">eventData</span> 
object by event handler because JavaScript passes objects by reference and changing the 
<span class="argument">eventData</span> within the handler will change the original object.
<div style="height: 10px"></div>

You can also define <span class="argument">eventData.onComplete</span> as
a call back when the default actions of the event are completed if you need to do some actions after event has
been processed.
