Building Data Intensive UI in JavaScript with W2UI

UI is one of the most important aspects of your web application, as often your entire applications will be judged by how
it looks and feels to the end user. There are a number of options when it comes to building a desktop-like web application, 
but there is a big dilemma. All of the options are either proprietary solutions like ExtJS and KendoUI or mismatched sets of
open-source libraries that do not always play nicely together.

W2UI intends to fill this gap by providing a complete, minimal set of UI widgets to build your next data intensive web app
and enjoy doing it. In this talk I will overview available options, talk about pros and cons of various UI solution for data
intensive web apps and demo how to use W2UI to build a compelling web application that looks and feels as it was a native 
desktop application.
