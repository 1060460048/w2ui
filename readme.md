## Web 2.0 UI

JavaScript UI libraries for building rich Internet data-driven application. The library has a small foot print and 
has no dependencies. At this moment Web 2.0 UI is released under GPL licence (contact me if you need it under a different 
licence).

## Installation

To use this library all you need to do is to download and put it on your web server. The server side is written in PHP, but 
any languge can be used. I am more concerned with the JavaScript part then PHP, but somthing need to provide db connectivity, 
hence PHP. The PHP part supports 2 databases at the moment MySQL and PostgreSQL.
