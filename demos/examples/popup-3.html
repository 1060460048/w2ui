		<h1>Based on Markup</h1>
		You can completely load popup window from a markup. It will read title, body, buttons, as well as width and height of the new
		popup content. See example below hot it works. The div that contains markup should have style="display: none", so it would not
		be visible on the page, if you include it into the same page.
